/*
 * QUICR-Q:
 * 
 * Prototyping of quic real-time on top of picoquic.
 * 
 * The prototype will implement several variations of QUICR: stream, rush, and datagrams.
 * These variants use common "glue" code to interface with picoquic:
 *  - feeding media frames for transmission
 *  - providing media frames for rendering
 *  - implementing the picoquic callback
 *  - implementing the socket loop used by picoquic.
 * The socket loop is adapted to wait for media input or end of rendering as well as packet arrival.
